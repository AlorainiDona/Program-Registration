Ms. Abeer is arranging for a professional training program. The hierarchical structure of the university forms a tree rooted at the universityâ€™s chief executive officer. The employees are 
ranked by the HR office based on their evaluation, which is a real number. In order to make the best utilization of the program, the chief executive officer does not want both an employee and
his or her immediate head to attend. Ms. Abeer is given the tree that describes the structure of the university, using the tree data structure. Each node of the tree holds, in addition to the
pointers, the name and evaluation-based ranking of an employee. Assume a complete binary tree. Describe two algorithms to make up a program registration offer list that maximizes the sum of the 
evaluation-based ratings of the employees such that an employee does not attend with his/her immediate head, using Brute Force and Dynamic Programming. Analyze the running time of your algorithms.
